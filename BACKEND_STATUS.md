# ClauseFinder Backend Status

## Overview
The backend for ClauseFinder has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1. **DeepSeek AI Integration** - Using the DeepSeek API to analyze contracts, compare documents, and power the Legal Copilot
2. **API Endpoints** - Fully functional REST API for all application features
3. **Development Mode** - Mock implementations for external services when credentials aren't available

## Working Features

### AI Integration
- ✅ Contract analysis using DeepSeek API
- ✅ Contract comparison 
- ✅ Legal copilot chat
- ✅ Fallback to mock responses when API key is unavailable

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/test` - Simple test endpoint
- ✅ `/api/analyze/test` - Contract analysis endpoint
- ✅ `/api/upload` - File upload and text extraction
- ✅ `/api/analyze` - Full contract analysis 
- ✅ `/api/analyze/compare` - Contract comparison
- ✅ `/api/chat` - Legal copilot conversation
- ✅ `/api/contracts` - Contract management
- ✅ `/api/dashboard` - Dashboard statistics
- ✅ `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - Authentication

### Database Integration
- ✅ Supabase integration with fallback to in-memory storage
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations for contracts, analyses, comparisons, etc.

### Real-time Updates
- ✅ Pusher integration with fallback to mock implementation
- ✅ Real-time notifications for analysis progress, chat messages, etc.

### Authentication
- ✅ NextAuth.js integration with multiple provider options
- ✅ Development mode credentials provider

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are used:

- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` - DeepSeek API key for AI features (currently set)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL (optional for development)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key (optional for development)
- `PUSHER_APP_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY`, `PUSHER_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER` - Pusher credentials (optional for development)

## Development vs. Production

In development mode:
- Missing credentials trigger mock implementations instead of errors
- In-memory storage is used when Supabase credentials are missing
- Mock Pusher client/server when Pusher credentials are missing
- Credentials provider is used for authentication when OAuth credentials are missing

For production deployment:
1. Set up a Supabase project and configure tables
2. Set up a Pusher account for real-time notifications
3. Configure OAuth providers as needed
4. Ensure DeepSeek API key is set
